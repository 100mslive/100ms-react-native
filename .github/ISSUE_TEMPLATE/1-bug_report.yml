        Please provide a minimal code example that reproduces the problem or a link to a repository on GitHub.
        You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is relevant to your bug report.
        Here are some tips for providing a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve

        Alternatively, you can use any editor
        which is capable of creating and running small React Native apps.
        Without this we will unlikely be able to progress on the issue, and because of that
        we regretfully will have to close it.
