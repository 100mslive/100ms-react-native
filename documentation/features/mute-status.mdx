# Mute/Unmute status

Mute/Unmute is something that applies to both audio and video. Mute/Unmute can be done for local peer as well as remote peer according to their mute status.
In most of the cases you would need to render the components on basis of current mute status of peers like their mic and camera icons.

```js
isAudioMute: boolean = peer?.audioTrack?.isMute(),
isVideoMute: boolean = peer?.videoTrack?.isMute(),
```
For muting local peer refer to `mute` docs, for muting remote peer refer to `change track state` docs 
and for muting remote peers locally refer to `playback allowed` docs.
