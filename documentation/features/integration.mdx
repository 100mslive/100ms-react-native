# Integrating the SDK

## Installing the dependencies

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/react-native-hms
```

## Permissions

### For iOS

Add following lines in `Info.plist` file

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Camera to enable video conferencing</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to network usage to enable video conferencing</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Microphone to enable video conferencing</string>
```

### For Android

Add following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.

We suggest using [react-native-permission](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions) to acquire permissions from both platforms.
