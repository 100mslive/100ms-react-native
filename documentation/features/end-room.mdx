# End Room

If the local peer has endRoom permission they can end a room. It's also possible to lock the room to prevent any future rejoins.

## Check if user has permissions

```js
const endRoom: boolean = peer.role.permissions.endRoom;
```

## End Room for all

```js
const reason = 'Host ended the room';
const lock = false;

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.endRoom(lock, reason);
```

## End Room Notification

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls endRoom, all other peers in the room will receive a notification with type ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM with a HMSLeaveRoomRequest object as the data.

```js
// import classes
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions, HMSLeaveRoomRequest } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

const onRemovedFromRoom = (data: HMSLeaveRoomRequest) => {
    // redirect to home screen
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM, onRemovedFromRoom);
```
