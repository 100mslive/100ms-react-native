# Chat
What's a video without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

## Sending Chat Messages
With the HMSSDK instance call sendMessage to send a message.

```js
// import HMSMessage class
import { HMSMessage } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

const messageObject = {
  type: 'chat',                     
  time: new Date().toISOString(),   // The time the message was sent is contained in time as a Java Date.
  message: value,                  // The body of the message is in message as a String.
}

const message = new HMSMessage(messageObject);

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.send(message);
```

## Receiving Chat Messages
When you called hmsInstance.join(config) to join a room, add a ON_MESSAGE event listener with callback function onMessageReceived.
```js
// import HMSUpdateListenerActions,HMSMessage classes
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions, HMSMessage } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_MESSAGE,
    onMessageReceived,
);

const onMessageReceived = (message: HMSMessage) => {
    // perform action
};
```

## Putting together a list of chat messages.
The UI is completely up to you to decide! You'll also need to hold onto all the received messages if you want to display history.
