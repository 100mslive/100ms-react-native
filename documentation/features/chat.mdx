# Chat
What's a video without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

## Sending Chat Messages
With the HMSSDK instance call different send message functions.

### Broadcast Messages
This will be received by everyone in the room.

```js
// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.sendBroadcastMessage("hello everyone!"); // yes it's that simple ðŸ˜‰
```

### Group Messages
This will be received by every peer who is part of the passed in roles.

```js
// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.sendGroupMessage("hi folks!", ['moderator', 'host']);
```

### Direct Messages
This will only be received by the peer whom the message was sent to.

```js
// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.sendDirectMessage("keep this message a secret!", peer.id);
```

## Receiving Chat Messages
When you called hmsInstance.join(config) to join a room, add a ON_MESSAGE event listener with callback function onMessageReceived.
```js
// import HMSUpdateListenerActions,HMSMessage classes
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions, HMSMessage } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_MESSAGE,
    onMessageReceived,
);

const onMessageReceived = (message: HMSMessage) => {
    // perform action
};
```

## Putting together a list of chat messages.
The UI is completely up to you to decide! You'll also need to hold onto all the received messages if you want to display history.
