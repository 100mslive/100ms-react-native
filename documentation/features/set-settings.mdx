# Set settings
You can set the quality and description of the audio tracks while creating 100ms instances with props like codec, maxBitrate and trackDescription. 
Similarly with video tracks as well using props like codec, maxBitrate, maxFrameRate, cameraFacing, resolution and trackDescription.
These settings are a optional parameter and can be passed in the build function as `trackSettings` parameter which is a `HMSTrackSettings` object.

## codec
This can effectively reduce the storage space and the bandwidth required for transmission of the stored audio/video file. 
It is a computer program capable of encoding or decoding a digital data stream into a format that can later be decoded or edited.

```js
// audio codec
HMSAudioCodec.opus

// video codec
HMSVideoCodec.h264
HMSVideoCodec.vp8
HMSVideoCodec.vp9
HMSVideoCodec.h265
```

## maxBitrate
Property specifies the maximum number of bits per second to allow a track.

## maxFrameRate
Frames Per Second is used to measure frame rate â€“ the number of consecutive full-screen images that are displayed each second

## cameraFacing
Property specifies which camera to open while joining. It can be toggled later on.

```js
HMSCameraFacing.FRONT
HMSCameraFacing.BACK
```

## resolution
Video resolution is the number of pixels contained in each frame. 
Video resolution determines the amount of detail in your video or how realistic and clear the video appears.

```js
import HmsManager, {
  HMSAudioTrackSettings,
  HMSAudioCodec,
  HMSVideoTrackSettings,
  HMSVideoCodec,
  HMSCameraFacing,
  HMSVideoResolution,
  HMSTrackSettings
} from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

const getTrackSettings = () => {
  let audioSettings = new HMSAudioTrackSettings({. 
    codec: HMSAudioCodec.opus,                    
    maxBitrate: 32,                               
    trackDescription: 'Simple Audio Track',       
  });
  
  let videoSettings = new HMSVideoTrackSettings({
    codec: HMSVideoCodec.vp8,                     
    maxBitrate: 512,                              
    maxFrameRate: 25,                             
    cameraFacing: HMSCameraFacing.FRONT,          
    trackDescription: 'Simple Video Track',       
    resolution: new HMSVideoResolution({height: 180, width: 320}), 
  });
  
  return new HMSTrackSettings({video: videoSettings, audio: audioSettings});
}

const trackSettings = getTrackSettings();
const build = await HmsManager.build({trackSettings});
```
