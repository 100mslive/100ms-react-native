# Mute / Unmute
Mute is something that applies to both audio and video. 

When you mute audio, you can't be heard by other people. 

When you mute video, you will not be broadcasting your video to other people.

It can be called on local (you) peers' audio or video tracks.

You get a reference to your own local peer from localPeer on HMSSDK instance.

```js
// instance acquired from build() method

hmsInstance.localPeer.localAudioTrack().setMute(true); // audio track

hmsInstance.localPeer.localVideoTrack().setMute(true); // video track

```
