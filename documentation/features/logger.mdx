HMSLogger is a logging api that lets you see all the other api logs as they are called. Instead of logging the values on your app in each and every function you can easily monitor and debug via these logs.

```js
import { HMSLogger, HMSLogLevel } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// create HMSLogger instance and set log level
const logger = new HMSLogger();
logger.updateLogLevel(HMSLogLevel.VERBOSE, true);

// instance acquired from build method
build.setLogger(logger);
```


## HMSLogLevel

You can subscribe to different log levels by passing `HMSLogLevel` enums to `HMSLogger`

```js
HMSLogLevel.VERBOSE
HMSLogLevel.WARNING
HMSLogLevel.ERROR
```
