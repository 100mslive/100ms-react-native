title: Release Resources 
nav: 3.96

Releasing resources when they are not required anymore is an important part of the app.

If the resources are not released and acquired again time to time, 
it might hamper app performance. 

When the hms instance is not required any more or when a new hms instance has to be created instead of using the previous one, `destroy` the previous instance. 

```js
// instance aquired from build method 
hmsInstance?.destroy();
```
