Changing track state is a concept that allows users to mute other peers's audio / video and request unmute other peer's audio / video if they have required permissions or not according to their role.

## Check if user has permissions

```js
const mute: boolean = peer.role.permissions.mute;
const unmute: boolean = peer.role.permissions.unmute;
```

## Example

Imagine a room with 10 people having 3 speakers and they have to speak one by one. The first speaker can mute other 2 speakers and start. After some point when the first speaker is finished they can mute himself and request other speakers to unmute.

## Mute other tracks

If you have the required permissions you can mute remote tracks audio / video. The track of the remote peer would be muted without any requests.

```js
const mute: boolean = true;

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance?.changeTrackState(audioTrack as HMSTrack, mute);
hmsInstance?.changeTrackState(videoTrack as HMSTrack, mute);
```

## Unmute other tracks

If you have the required permissions you can request to unmute remote tracks audio / video. If the request is accepted by the remote peer ON_TRACK_UPDATE listener will get triggered.

```js
const unmute: boolean = false;

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance?.changeTrackState(audioTrack as HMSTrack, unmute);
hmsInstance?.changeTrackState(videoTrack as HMSTrack, unmute);
```

## Accept Track change request

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls change track state or unmute, you can either accept or reject the request.

```js
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions, HMSChangeTrackStateRequest } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// add change track state listener
hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_CHANGE_TRACK_STATE_REQUEST,
  onChangeTrackStateRequest,
);

// reject or accept the request
const onChangeTrackStateRequest = (data: HMSChangeTrackStateRequest) => {
  const requestedBy = data?.requestedBy?.name
  const trackType = data?.trackType            
  if( trackType === 'audio' ) {
    hmsInstance?.localPeer?.localAudioTrack()?.setMute(false);
  } else if ( trackType === 'video' ) {
      hmsInstance?.localPeer?.localVideoTrack()?.setMute(false);
  }
};
```
