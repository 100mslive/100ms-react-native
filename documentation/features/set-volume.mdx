title: Set Volume

It allows you to locally vary the volume level of the remote peer's audio track.


Suppose a remote peer is too loud compared to others you can reduce their volume level and vice versa.


Volume can vary from 0(min) to 10(max). The default value for volume would be 1.0

```js
const volume: Float = 1.0;
const track: HMSTrack = remotePeer.audioTrack as HMSTrack;

//hms instance acquired by build method
instance?.setVolume(track, volume);
```
