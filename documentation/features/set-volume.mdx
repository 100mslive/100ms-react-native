# Set Volume

This is a android only API. It allows you to vary the volume level of the remote peer individually for yourself. 
Suppose a remote peer is too loud compared to others you can reduce their volume level and vice versa.
Volume can vary from 0(min) to 1(max).

```js
const volume: Float = 0.5;
const track: HMSTrack = remotePeer.audioTrack as HMSTrack;

//hms instance acquired by build method
instance?.setVolume(track, volume);
```
