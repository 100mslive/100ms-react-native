# 100ms Virtual Background Sample App

This is a React Native sample app demonstrating the Virtual Background feature with the 100ms React Native SDK.

## Requirements

### Minimum Configuration

- React Native 0.73.0 or above
- Java 17 or above
- Android API level 24 or above
- Xcode 14 or above
- iOS 16 or above
- Node.js 22 or above

### Recommended Configuration

- React Native 0.77.3 or above
- Java 17 or above
- Android API level 35 or above
- Xcode 15 or above
- iOS 16 or above
- Node.js 22 or above

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

Start Metro, the JavaScript bundler that ships with React Native:

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project and run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

#### For iOS

First, install the iOS dependencies:

```bash
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

Then run the app:

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
