## üîê Permissions

### üì± For iOS Permissions

Add following lines in `Info.plist` file

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Camera to enable video conferencing</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Microphone to enable video conferencing</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to network usage to enable video conferencing</string>
```

### ü§ñ For Android Permissions

Add following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.

We suggest using [react-native-permission](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions) to acquire permissions from both platforms.

More information about Audio Video Permission on iOS & Android is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/integration#permissions).

## [QuickStart](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/guides/quickstart)

The package exports all the classes and a HMSSDK class that manages everything.

## [Setting up the HMS Instance](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/install-the-sdk/hmssdk)

First invoke the `build` method which returns an instance of `HMSSDK`. Save this instance to perform all actions related to 100ms.

```ts
import { HMSSDK } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

/**
 * create HMSSDK instance using the build method & save it for further usage
 *
 * Important Note: Don't build new `HMSSDK` instance before destroying the previous one.
 * for more info checkout {@link https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/install-the-sdk/hmssdk#what-does-destroy-method-do}
 */
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build();
```

## [Get Authentication Token](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/get-started/quickstart#fetch-token-to-join-the-room)

### Fetch token using room-code method (Recommended)

We can get the authentication token using room-code from meeting URL.

Let's understand the subdomain and code from the sample URL

In this sample url: `http://100ms-rocks.app.100ms.live/meeting/abc-defg-hij`

- Subdomain is `100ms-rocks`
- Room code is `abc-defg-hij`

Now to get the room-code from meeting URL, we can write our own logic or use the `getCode` method from [here](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/blob/main/packages/react-native-hms/example/src/utils/getRoomLinkDetails.ts)

To generate token we will be using `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` method available on `HMSSDK` instance. This method has `roomCode` as a required
parameter and `userId` & `endpoint` as optional parameter.

Let's checkout the implementation:

```js
/**
 * `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` returns a promise which is resolved with "auth token"
 * checkout {@link https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/install-the-sdk/hmssdk#what-does-destroy-method-do}
 */
const token = await hmsInstance.getAuthTokenByRoomCode('YOUR_ROOM_CODE');

/**
 * Create `HMSConfig` with the above auth token and username
 */
const hmsConfig = new HMSConfig({
  authToken: token,
  username: 'John Appleseed',
});
```

### Get temporary token from dashboard

To test audio/video functionality, you need to connect to a 100ms Room. Please check the following steps for the same -

1. Navigate to your [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) or [create an account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one.
2. Use the `Video Conferencing Starter Kit` to create a room with a default template assigned to it to test this app quickly.
3. Go to the [Rooms page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) in your dashboard, click on the `Room Id` of the room you created above, and click on the `Join Room` button on the top right.
4. You will see 100ms demo URLs for the roles created when you deployed the starter kit; you can click on the 'key' icon to copy the token and update the `AUTH_TOKEN` variable in "App.js" file.
   > Token from 100ms dashboard is for testing purposes only, For production applications you must generate tokens on your own server. Refer to the [Management Token section](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/security-and-tokens#management-token-for-rest-api) in Authentication and Tokens guide for more information.

## [Add Event Listeners](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/event-listeners)

Add Event Listeners to get notified about actions happening in the 100ms Room.

The most commonly used Events are `onJoin`, `onPeerUpdate` & `onTrackUpdate`. All the available actions can be found in the `HMSUpdateListenerActions` class.

The Event Listeners are to be used for handling any update happening in 100ms Room.

```ts
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build();

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_JOIN,
  joinSuccess // function that will be called Joining a Room is successful
);
```

The detailed QuickStart Guide is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/guides/quickstart).

## [Join the Room](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/join)

To interact with _peers_ in audio or video call, the user needs to **Join** a **Room**.

When user indicates that they want to join the room, your app should have -

1. User Name - The name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.

2. Authentication Token - The Client side Authentication Token generated by the Token Service. Details about how to create Auth Tokens are [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/guides/token).

Additionally, you can also pass these fields while Joining a Room -

1. Track Settings - Such as joining a Room with Muted Audio or Video using the `HMSTrackSettings` object. More information is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/join#join-with-muted-audio-video).

2. Peer Metadata - This can be used to pass any additional metadata associated with the user using `metadata` of `HMSConfig` object. For Eg: user-id mapping at the application side. More information is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/advanced-features/change-metadata).

NOTE: `ON_JOIN` Event Listener must be **attached** before calling `join` function to receive the event callback.

```ts
// create HMSSDK instance using the build function
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build();

// Generate 100ms Auth Token by Room Code
const token = await hmsInstance.getAuthTokenByRoomCode('abc-defg-hij'); // Sample Room Code

// You'll need to add Event Listeners for HMSUpdateListenerActions, which are invoked to notify about updates happening in the room like a peer joins/leaves, a track got muted/unmuted, any errors that occur, etc.
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_JOIN, onJoinSuccess);
hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE,
  onPeerUpdate
);
hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE,
  onTrackUpdate
);
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR, onError);

// Next, create an object of HMSConfig class using the available joining configurations.
let config = new HMSConfig({
  authToken: token, // client-side token generated by `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` method
  username: 'John Appleseed',
});

// Now, we are primed to join the room. All you have to do is calling join by passing the config object
hmsInstance.join(config);
```

More information about Joining a Room is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/join).

## Basic Mechanism of using 100ms APIs

For invoking any actions simply use the `HMSSDK` instance created in above steps. Few common examples of using it are as follows -

```ts
// To Mute Audio of local peer - other peers will stop hearing audio
hmsInstance?.localPeer?.localAudioTrack()?.setMute(true);

// To Mute Video of local peer - other peers will stop seeing video
hmsInstance?.localPeer?.localVideoTrack()?.setMute(true);

// Switch Camera from Front to Back or vice-versa
hmsInstance?.localPeer?.localVideoTrack()?.switchCamera();

// Leave the ongoing Room (async function)
await hmsInstance?.leave();

// To send a Chat Message to all peers in Room
await hmsInstance?.sendBroadcastMessage('Hello Everyone! üëã');
```

More information about using `HMSSDK` APIs is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/guides/quickstart).

## [Viewing the Video](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/render-video)

It all comes down to this. All the setup so far has been done so that we can show Live Streaming Video in our beautiful apps.

100ms React Native SDK provides `HmsView` component that renders the video on the screen. You can access `HmsView` from the `HMSSDK` instance created in above steps.

We simply have to pass a Video Track's `trackId` to the `HmsView` to begin automatic rendering of Live Video Stream.

We can also optionally pass props like `key`, `scaleType`, `mirror` to customize the `HmsView` component.

```ts
// get HmsView from the HMSSDK instance created earlier
const HmsView = hmsInstance.HmsView;

<HmsView trackId={videoTrackId} key={videoTrackId} style={styles.hmsView} />;

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  hmsView: {
    height: '100%',
    width: '100%',
  },
});
```

- One `HmsView` component can only be connected with one video `trackId`. To display multiple videos you have to create multiple instances of `HmsView` component.

- It's recommended to always pass the `key` property while creating `HmsView`. If a null or undefined `trackId` is passed in `HmsView` you will have to unmount and remount with the new `trackId`. Using the `key` prop and passing `trackId` to it automatically achieves this.

- `HmsView` component requires `width` and `height` in `style` prop to set bounds of the tile that will show the video stream.

- Once the requirement of that `HmsView` is finished it should **ALWAYS** be disposed.

- Recommended practice is to show maximum of 3 to 4 `HmsView` on a single page/screen of the app. This avoids overloading network data consumption & video decoding resources of the device.

More information about Rendering Videos is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/render-video).

## [Using Track Updates to display Videos](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/render-video)

Always use ON_PEER_UPDATE and ON_TRACK_UPDATE listeners, these listeners get updated localPeer and remotePeers whenever there is any event related to these values.
The following code snippet shows a simple example of attaching Track Updates Event Listener & using it to show a Video.

```ts
// In this example code snippet, We are keeping things very simple.
// You will get an overview of how to render `HMSView`s for list of `trackId`s and how to keep that list up to date.
// We don't need `ON_PEER_UPDATE` event listener for keeping track of only `trackId`s.
// So, we have registered only `ON_TRACK_UPDATE` event listener here

const [trackIds, setTrackIds] = useState<string[]>([]);

const onTrackListener = (data: { peer: HMSPeer; track: HMSTrack; type: HMSTrackUpdate }) => {
  // We will only consider Video tracks for this example
  if (data.track.type !== HMSTrackType.VIDEO) return;

  // If Video track is added, add trackId to our list
  if (data.type === HMSTrackUpdate.TRACK_ADDED) setTrackIds(prevTrackIds => [...prevTrackIds, data.track.trackId]);

  // If Video track is removed, remove trackId from our list
  if (data.type === HMSTrackUpdate.TRACK_REMOVED) setTrackIds(prevTrackIds => prevTrackIds.filter(prevTrackId => prevTrackId !== data.track.trackId));
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE,
  onTrackListener
);

// Render multiple HMSView for trackIds inside FlatList
// Note: HMSView will render blank if video track of peer is muted, Make sure video of peers is not muted.
<FlatList
  data={trackIds} // trackIds is an array of trackIds of video tracks
  keyExtractor={(trackId) => trackId}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <HMSView key={item} trackId={item} style={{ width: '100%', height: 300 }} {...} />}
  {...}
/>
```
