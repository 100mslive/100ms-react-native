## üîê Permissions

### üì± For iOS Permissions

Add following lines in `Info.plist` file

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Camera to enable video conferencing</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Microphone to enable video conferencing</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to network usage to enable video conferencing</string>
```

### ü§ñ For Android Permissions

Add following permissions in `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.

We suggest using [react-native-permission](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions) to acquire permissions from both platforms.

More information about Audio Video Permission on iOS & Android is [available here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/integration#permissions).

## Overview

This guide will walk you through simple instructions to create a Video Conferencing app using the 100ms Prebuilt and test it using an Emulator or your Mobile Phone.

## Create a sample app

This section contains instructions to create a simple React Native Video Conferencing app. We will help you with instructions to understand the project setup and complete code sample to implement this quickly.

<div className="steps-container">

### Prerequisites

- A [100ms account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one already.
- Working [React Native Development Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for React Native CLI
- Familiar with basics of [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started).
- [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any other IDE / code editor

### Create a React Native app

Once you have the prerequisites, follow the steps below to create a React Native app. This guide will use [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use any code editor or IDE.

1. Open your Terminal and navigate to directory/folder where you would like to create your app.

2. Run the below command to create React Native app:
   ‚Äã

```bash section=CreateRnApp
npx react-native init PrebuiltSampleApp --version 0.68.5 --npm && cd ./PrebuiltSampleApp
```

3. Once the app is created, open it in VS code.

4. Test run your app

   a. Build the App
   ‚Äã

   #### For Android

   ```bash section=BuildApp sectionIndex=1 tab=Android
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

   #### For iOS

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
   ```

   b. Start Metro Bundler if it is not already started
   ‚Äã

   ```bash
   npx react-native start
   ```

   or follow instructions printed in Terminal to start the Metro Bundler or Run the Application.

### Install the Dependencies

After the Test run of your app is successful, you can install [100ms React Native Room Kit package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@100mslive/react-native-room-kit) in your app.

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/react-native-room-kit
```

#### Install the Peer Dependencies

1. react-native-permissions package
   Since the app and `@100mslive/react-native-room-kit` package requires Camera & Microphone permissions, a package for requesting these permissions from users should also be installed. We recommend using the
   [react-native-permissions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions) package.

```bash
npm install react-native-permissions@3.4.0
```

Native File Changes for `react-native-permissions` package -

#### For Android

1. Allow camera, recording audio and internet permissions by adding the below snippet to the `AndroidManifest.xml` file (at the application tag level).

```xml section=androidPermissions
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

2. Change `minSdkVersion` to 24 in the `android/build.gradle` file

```json{4}
buildscript {
  ext {
    ...
    minSdkVersion = 24
    ...
  }
}
```

#### For iOS

1. Allow camera, recording audio and internet permissions

Add the below snippet in the `info.plist` file -

```xml section=ForIOSPermissions sectionIndex=1
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Camera to enable video conferencing</string>

<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to Microphone to enable video conferencing</string>

<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Please allow access to network usage to enable video conferencing</string>
```

2. Add the below snippet in the `ios/Podfile` file -

```json{3-6}
target 'PrebuiltSampleApp' do
...
  permissions_path = '../node_modules/react-native-permissions/ios'

  pod 'Permission-Camera', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Camera"
  pod 'Permission-Microphone', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Microphone"
...
end
```

If you see any permission related error, then check out `react-native-permissions` library [setup guide](https://github.com/zoontek/react-native-permissions/tree/3.4.0#setup) for `v3.4.0`.

> Note: If you have already setup the `react-native-permissions` package, then you can continue with your existing setup.

> Note: iOS simulator and android emulator doesn't support actual video, you need actual devices to see your video in real-time.

2. react-native-reanimated package
   `react-native-reanimated` package is required for adding animated views.

```bash
npm install react-native-reanimated@2.17.0
```

Follow [official installation steps](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/2.x/fundamentals/installation) for `v2.17.0`.

> Note: If you already have the setup for `react-native-reanimated` package, then you can continue with your existing setup. We recommend using `>= 2.x.x` versions.

#### Install the dependencies of react-native-room-kit package

`react-native-room-kit` package depends upon many other packages. These packages to be your app's direct dependencies so that `react-native` can link them.

```bash
npm install @100mslive/react-native-hms
  @shopify/flash-list@1.4.3
  react-native-keyboard-controller@^1.6.1
  react-native-linear-gradient@2.7.3
  react-native-modal@12.1.0
  react-native-safe-area-context@3.3.0
  react-native-simple-toast@1.1.3
```

1. Native File Changes for `@100mslive/react-native-hms` package

#### For iOS

Change ios target platform version to '13.0' in the `ios/Podfile` file

```json{4}
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

platform :ios, '13.0'
install! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false
```

Follow official installation steps of these libraries if you encounter any problem in setup.

> Note: If you already have the setup for any of the listed package, then you may continue with your existing setup. If some problem occurs then try using specified version for the package.

#### Configure Inter Font Family

`react-native-room-kit` package uses 'Inter' font family for texts. You need to add 'Inter' fonts in your app.

#### Enable Background modes for iOS

You can enable background modes for audio in iOS. so that when you minimze the app, room audio can still be heared by the users.

Paste the following in your `Info.plist` file -

```xml{3-6}
<dict>
  ...
	<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
	<array>
		<string>audio</string>
	</array>
  ...
</dict>
```

#### Additional Setup

You can follow [ScreenShare setup](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/screenshare) and [AudioShare setup](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/local-audio-share) guides to add ScreenShare and Audio Share features in your app.

After doing changes related to ScreenShare feature, To use screenshare feature on iOS, pass `appGroup` and `preferredExtension` options to `HMSPrebuilt` componnets -

```js{6-7}
<HMSPrebuilt
  roomCode="..."
  options={{
    ...
    ios: {
      appGroup: "...";
      preferredExtension: "...";
    }
  }}
/>
```
